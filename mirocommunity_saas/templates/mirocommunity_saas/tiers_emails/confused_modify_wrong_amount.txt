Hi, support team. I'm kind of worried.

A Miro Community site just submitted a payment modification that
changes the payment amount to something we would never ask for.

What can this mean? It either indicates a but in Miro Community,
or a user that is monkeying with payment amounts.

Anyway, you should take a look at the site and the PayPal
payment profiles.

The site's domain:
    {{ site_domain }}

You're using this email address with PayPal:
    {{ paypal_email_address }}

The recurring payment profile ID:
    {{ profile_on_file }}

Because I wasn't sure what to do, I ignored the change.

Sincerely,

A confused robot.
