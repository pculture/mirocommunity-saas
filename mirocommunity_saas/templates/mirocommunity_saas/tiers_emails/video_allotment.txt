You have just exceeded 2/3 of your video allotment - upgrade for more!

Right now, you have {{ video_count }} videos on your site, http://{{site.domain}}/.
Once you reach {{ tier_obj.videos_limit }} videos, you will no longer be able to add new videos to your site
until you remove some.

To get more space for videos, as well as enjoy additional features, you can upgrade now:

http://{{site.domain}}{% url localtv_admin_tier %}

Or you can cull some videos from your current offerings on the Bulk Edit page:

http://{{site.domain}}{% url localtv_admin_bulk_edit %}
