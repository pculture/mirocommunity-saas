Dear {{ user.first_name|default:user.username }},

Thank you for using Miro Community. Unfortunately, due to limited funds, we are discontinuing the service on April 1st, 2014.{% if tier.price > 0 %} As part of the transition, we will no longer bill you after January 1st, 2014. Your site will continue to operate at its current level until it is deactivated in April.  We hope this gives you plenty of time to make a transition.{% endif %}

Miro Community has always been an open-source project, and the code will continue to be available at [github.com/pculture/mirocommunity](http://github.com/pculture/mirocommunity) if you would like to install it on a different web hosting platform. We may be able to provide some assistance, if this is a path you choose to take.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes.

Best wishes,  
Stephen Burrows  
Miro Community Dev
