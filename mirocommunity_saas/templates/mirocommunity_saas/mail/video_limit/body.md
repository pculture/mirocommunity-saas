You're currently at {{ ratio|floatformat:0 }}% of your video allotment on <http://{{ site.domain }}/>. Once you reach {{ tier.video_limit }} videos, you will no longer be able to add new videos to your site until you remove some.

To get more space for videos (and enjoy additional features) you can [upgrade now](http://{{ site.domain }}{% url localtv_admin_tier %}) - or you can [cull some videos from your current offerings](http://{{ site.domain }}{% url localtv_admin_bulk_edit %}).
