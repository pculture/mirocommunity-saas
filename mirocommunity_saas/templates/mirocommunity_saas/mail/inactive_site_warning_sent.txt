We've noticed that you haven't logged in to your Miro Community site in about
{{ time_since_last_admin_login }}. Community video sites are most engaging when they're updated
regularly, so that users know they can come to you for fresh content.

You currently have:

{% if videos_awaiting_review %}
{{ videos_awaiting_review}} video{{videos_awaiting_revies|pluralize}} awaiting review
   Handle them: http://{{ site.domain }}{% url localtv_admin_approve_reject %}
{% endif %}
{% if comments_awaiting_review %}
{{ comments_awaiting_review }} comment{{comments_awaiting_review|pluralize}} awaiting review
   Handle them: http://{{ site.domain }}{% url comments-moderation-queue %}
{% endif %}

Need inspiration? Try:

* Searching for videos: http://{{ site.domain }}{% url localtv_admin_search %}
* Checkout other Miro Community sites: http://mirocommunity.org/

If no administrator logs on to your site in the next month, your feeds will
stop updating. Don't worry - as soon as you log in again, all your feeds will
refresh.
