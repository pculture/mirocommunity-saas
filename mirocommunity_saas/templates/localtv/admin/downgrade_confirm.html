  <h1>Warning!</h1>
  <h2>Downgrading to {{ tier.name }} will cause the following changes:</h2>

  {% if form.is_cancellation and tier_info.enforce_payments %}
    <h3>Cancel your Subscription</h3>

    <p>In order to stop your payments, you will need to cancel your subscription in Paypal. Please note that this change will be effective immediately, and cannot be reversed.</p><p>To cancel your current subscription:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Click "Yes, Do It" button below. </li>
      <li> On PayPal account management page, log in if prompted to do so.</li>
      <li> Click "Details" link for your current payment. </li>
      <li> On the Transactions Details page, click "View Details" link.</li>
      <li> On Subscription Details page, click "Cancel" link.</li>
    </ol>
  {% endif %}

    <h3>Limit of {{ tier.admins_limit }} admins</h3>
    <p>The following current administrators will become regular users:</p>
    <ul>
      {% for user in admins_to_demote %}
        <li>{% if user.get_full_name %}{{ user.get_full_name }} ({{ user.username }}){% else %}{{ user.username }}{% endif %}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% endif %}

  {% if videos_to_deactivate %}
    <h3>Limit of {{ tier.video_limit }} videos</h3>
    <p>Since you are {{ videos_to_deactivate|length }} video{{videos_to_deactivate|length|pluralize}}
      over this limit, you will no longer be able to publish
      new videos. Videos submitted by users and videos from sources will go into your
      review queue, but you will not be able to approve them until you are within the
      limit.</p>

    <p>When you downgrade to {{ tier.name }}, the oldest {{ videos_to_deactivate|length }}
      video{{ videos_to_deactivate|length|pluralize }} will be unapproved
      and will return to the review queue. When you delete enough videos on the site
      to be under {{ tier.video_limit}}, you will be able to re-approve these videos.</p>
  {% endif %}

  {% if tier_info.tier.custom_css and not tier.custom_css %}
    <h3>Custom CSS</h3>
    <p>Any custom CSS you have entered will no longer be applied to
      your site, and you will not be able to edit the Custom CSS. If you
      upgrade back to a premium site, your Custom CSS will be preserved and
      applied.</p>
  {% endif %}

  {% if tier_info.tier.advertising and not tier.advertising %}
    <h3>Advertising</h3>
    <p>Advertising is only allowed on sites with a Premium or Max
      account level. If you downgrade to {{ tier.name }} and continue to run
      advertising for more than two weeks, we reserve the right to shut
      down your site.</p>
  {% endif %}

  {% if tier_info.tier.custom_domain and not tier.custom_domain and not tier_info.site.domain|endswith:".mirocommunity.org" %}

    <p>Custom domains are not offered with the {{ tier.name }} account level. If you downgrade, we will revert your site to a domain within
      mirocommunity.org.</p>
  {% endif %}

  {% if tier_info.tier.custom_theme and not tier.custom_theme %}

    <p>You will no longer be able to add custom themes. Custom themes that have
  previously been uploaded will be saved, but cannot be activated.</p>
